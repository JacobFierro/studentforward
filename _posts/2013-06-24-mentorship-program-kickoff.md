Student Forward offers ongoing mentorship by some amazing individuals to help students prepare for life after college, explore the potential of technology in the art and for a shoulder to lean of when things get tough. 

To kick off our program some of our students met with Jorge Padilla, MIT-graduate and current PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. Jorge plays trumpet with the UC Berkeley symphony orchestra and has just given a solo recital of the Kennan Sonata. Jorge knows and works with many professional musicians in the San Francisco area, he even played at the famous Yoshi's club with the Tito Gonzales earlier this year. Jorge is as at home discussing the art of trumpet playing as he is discussing the fluid dynamics of trumpet playing. We were especially pleased that some of our students were able to spend time with him.

After their meeting Jorge sent out one final piece of advice that is worth sharing:

> Embrace the triumphs and disappointments all along your journey as you develop into your own true artist.  Remember that there are no secrets or short-cuts that will help you achieve your goals - only hard work, patience, perseverance, awareness, education, honesty and passion. 

Truer words are rarely spoken. Thank you Jorge.
