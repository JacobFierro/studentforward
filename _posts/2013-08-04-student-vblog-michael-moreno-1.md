In this video blog Michael Moreno has just moved nearly 600 miles away from home to attend Texas Christian University and is sharing some insights about his new life in college and his first impressions of Student Forward (we didn’t bait him – honest!).

The student video blog series was created to allow future generations a peek at what lies ahead and for past generations a valuable insight into modern educational system from the most important perspective: the student’s! We follow their experiences through their own words and learn as much from them as they do from us.

Michael Moreno is one of Student Forward’s charter members.
