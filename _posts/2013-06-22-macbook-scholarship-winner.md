We are very pleased to announce Michael Moreno as our first ever recipient of the Helen P. Fierro Award, our annual technology in arts scholarship. Michael will recieve a 2013 Macbook Pro to take with him to college.


Michael is a very special individual who turned his life around when he fell in love with music. Having gotten into some trouble as a high school freshman he soon realized that he had to change his course if he were to ever be able to pursue a career as a serious musician and he did just that. Michael will be attending Texas Christian University in Dallas, Texas on a music scholarship.

As part of the larger Student Forward program, Michael will recieve ongoing career mentorship and one-on-one tutoring in computer programming.
